<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p id="firstparagraph">
  I'm in the process of learning the skills required to be a front-end developer and/or web designer.<br>
  I'm currently an executive assistant at Rock Ventures, LLC in Detroit, MI and would like to make a career<br>
  switch in order to better utilize my creativity. I hope to eventually master the following concepts: <br>
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>HTML5/CSS3</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>jQuery</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Node.js, NPM</li>
    <li>AJAX / json</li>
  </ol>
<p>
Not only would a coding camp potentially give me a great jumpstart into a new career,according to<br>
Saurabh Hooda (quoted below) at Entrepreneur Magazine India, it also would further develop my persistence.

<blockquote cite="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/289248">
  Programmers have to think logically about a problem. Once you start learning how to code, <br>
  you stop giving up on other difficult situations in your day-to-day life as well. You start <br>
  trying over and over again. You become patient because you know there is always a solution. <br>
  It just needs some more effort, just like it happens when you create a program, runs it, and <br>
  debug it several times to reach the perfect solution.
